# Closure
## Description
This project shows an example of closure in functional programing by displaying the output of two functions containing closed values. 
- func1 creates and instance of func2 with an inclosed value of 0 captured form func1.
- func2 returns the current value and then increment the value by 1.
- Two instances of the function are created.
- One function is chosen at random for each iteration.
- The DOM is manipulated to display the output.
